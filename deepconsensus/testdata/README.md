## DeepConsensus Test Data

### Test Data Setup

Test data can be generated by running:

```
time ./learning/genomics/deepconsensus/testdata/generate_testdata.sh
```

This will generate all the necessary files used for testing, including training
a toy model.

**Directories**:

*   `human_1m` - Derived from a human_1m dataset
*   `preprocess` - Simple toy datasets for testing preprocessing.
*   `model` - A toy model for testing.
